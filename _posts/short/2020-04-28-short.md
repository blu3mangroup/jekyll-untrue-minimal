Here is an initial short post. The theme works around two sections, the "short" section is for uncategorized daily thoughts, like a journal. They're presented using a date as the title, and with a small snippet of contained text displayed on the index page.

A consideration for this theme to work as intended is that you need to set the page title (in front matter) of short posts to be the date, manually. You could use any naming convention you like really, but the distinction between the two core categories is that short posts are meant for journal style writings where it would be more meaningful to delineate by date rather than a title. You see?
