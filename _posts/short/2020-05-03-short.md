The theme is designed to support images that are sized with a width of 360px, and centered. For this example post I found this excellent image of a pool.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Swimming Pool?](/jekyll-untrue-minimal/assets/img/StephanZirwes.jpg)
{: refdef}

The image was compressed for embedding using [Caesium](https://saerasoft.com/caesium/), which allows images to be resized. The source for this image is artist [Stephan Zirwes](https://stephanzirwes.com/). Images are stored in the ".../assets/img" directory

Due to the way the jekyll or kramdown works/wraps images, it seems the only way to achieve the correct image-centered post style is to manually include and enclose them like this within the post:

    {:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
    ![Hover text.](/assets/img/yourimage.jpg)
    {}: refdef}
