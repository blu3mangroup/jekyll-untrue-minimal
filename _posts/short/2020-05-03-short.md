Here's a third short post. This post is about an artist. I was looking through my inspiration folder today, and was struck by this image of a pool.

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Swimming Pool?](/jekyll-untrue-minimal/assets/img/StephanZirwes.jpg)
{: refdef}

The image was compressed for embedding using [Caesium](https://saerasoft.com/caesium/). By default this theme is designed to work nicely with images of width 360px. The name of the artist behind this image is [Stephan Zirwes](https://stephanzirwes.com/).
