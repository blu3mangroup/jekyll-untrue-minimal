Here's a third short post. This post is about an artist. I was looking through my inspiration folder today, and was struck by this image of a pool.

![Swimming Pool?](/jekyll-untrue-minimal/assets/img/StephanZirwes.jpg)

The image was compressed for embedding using [Caesium](https://saerasoft.com/caesium/). The name of the artist behind this image is [Stephan Zirwes](https://stephanzirwes.com/).
