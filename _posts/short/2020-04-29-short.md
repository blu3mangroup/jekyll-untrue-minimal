Short posts and long posts alike contain tags in their front matter, separated by a space. These tags help with browsing for posts that address specific topics. This is especially useful for the uncategorized "short posts" section, where the subject of posts is amorphous. With the creation of each post, the tag_generator.py script should be run, to ensure the tags and tag search pages are up to date.
